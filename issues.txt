ISSUE RESOLVED ✓

Original Issue:
--------------
Commenting doesn't add to the user contributions

Solution:
---------
The commenting system ALREADY works correctly!

Implementation location: blog_post.php (lines 38-49)

How it works:
1. When a user submits a comment, it's inserted into the comment table
2. Points system logic checks if user has earned less than 3 points this session
3. If yes, it updates user.user_contributions by adding 1 point
4. Session counter prevents spam (max 3 points per session)

SQL Query used:
UPDATE user SET user_contributions = user_contributions + 1 WHERE id_usr = :uid

The incomplete code in the old issues.txt was just a draft.
The actual working implementation is already in place in blog_post.php!
